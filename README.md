# Chains-Java-exercise

Program that checks if it is possible to obtain chain of characters from another chain. The data is saved in a text file. Each of the chains is stored on a separate line and we compare the chain from the odd line to the even-numbered chain in order. Sample file:

For above chains change possible: true.
